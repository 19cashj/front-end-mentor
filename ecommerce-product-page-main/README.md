## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) - State Management

- Tailwind
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I continued to learn state management through Nanostores.

I also used this project to learn Tailwind CSS which was fully utilized for styling.

This project also featured many interactive elements to further cement Javascript knowledge.

### Continued development

This project seems like a great start to implement a fully working ecommerce store with multiple items. I may build off of it later to fully implement this idea.
