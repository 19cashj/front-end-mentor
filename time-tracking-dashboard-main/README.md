## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) - State Management

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I learned basic state management in Astro using their recommended library: Nanostores.

I learned how to use Nanostores between Astro components and React components.

I also reinforced my knowledge of CSS flexbox + grid, and using a mobile first layout.

### Continued development

I retrieved data for this project from local JSON. For future projects, I would like to set up a backend + database to store and fetch data instead.

I am thinking an easier option (headless CMS), or possibly a more involved option (express server + ORM).
